      Next meetup on November 30 2022 in Otaniemi at 15:00. The room is TBA. This will be the

      and add features step by step. During the first meeting, we will have a general overview
      of a Julia library structure and general development workflow. As always, free of charge
      and refreshment included. If you are coming, please register by Thursday 24th November.
