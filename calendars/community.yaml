      Weekly virtual coffee break: The RSE Finland group invites all interested in research software engineering to the weekly online coffee break at 10:00 (Europe/Helsinki) every Thursday. The coffee break is an informal meeting, open for everyone to discuss with and listen to others interested in research software engineering. We currently have no pre-decided topics, but never run out of things to say.
