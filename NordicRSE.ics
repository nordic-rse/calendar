DESCRIPTION:The EU institutions are currently preparing a regulation on 
 Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is a complex process: The continuous and

 law is always behind the technology.\n\nThis presentation will outline the
  latest developments on the path to regulating AI and point out critical 
 aspects.\n\nThe event will include a 20-30 minute talk\, followed by 
 informal discussion.

SUMMARY:What a Research Software Engineering group at a Nordic university 
 looks like
UID:c2172ac2-dccb-473d-b8dc-1906d86a95fb@c217.org
DESCRIPTION:What does a Research Software Engineering (RSE) group at a 
 Nordic university look like?  Aalto RSE supports the whole university\, 
 and Richard Darst and other Aalto RSE members will discuss the history 
 behind their team\, the way it works\, future prospects\, and lessons for 
 others. This talk will focus on the administrative side of things\, and 
 discussion will focus on what one should know to reproduce this work at 
 other universities.\nAalto University is the leading technical university 
 in Finland. Started in 2020\, Aalto RSE now serves the entire university 
 in computing\, data\, and software problems. They work as part of Science-
 IT\, which is effectively the local "HPC team". They have good connections
  to the local IT Services\, Data Agents\, and other research services.

SUMMARY:Chapel: Making Parallel Programming Productive\, from laptops to 
 supercomputers
UID:f91a8e82-42e1-4850-945e-193a68b9a33d@f91a.org
DESCRIPTION:Over the past few decades\, a gulf has existed between 
 mainstream programming languages—like Python\, Java\, C++\, Rust\, or 
 Swift—and  technologies used in practice for programming 
 supercomputers—like MPI\, OpenSHMEM\, OpenMP\, CUDA\, OpenCL\, or 
 OpenACC.\nThis gulf results in making High Performance Computing something
  of a specialized skill that may not  be readily available to the general 
 programmer or applied computational scientist.\nIn some ways\, the problem
  has even gotten worse over time\, as the end of Moore's law has led to 
 building supercomputers using manycore processors and computational 
 accelerators like GPUs.\n\nIn this talk\, I will introduce 
 [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/)\, an open-source language created to 
 bridge this gulf.\nChapel strives to support code that is similarly 
 readable/writeable as Python\, yet without sacrificing the portability and
  scalable performance required to utilize supercomputers 
 effectively.\nSpecifically\, I will provide motivation for Chapel\, 
 present some of its unique features and themes\, introduce flagship 
 applications of Chapel\, and give a glimpse into our team's current 
 priorities.

 next event in the 2023 DiveRSE series\, Ella Kaye (Research Software 
 Engineer\,\nUniversity of Warwick) and Malvika Sharan (Senior Researcher –
  Open Research at the Alan\nTuring Institute and co-lead of The Turing 
 Way) will converse about their experiences in/with\nthe RSE community\, as
  well as both the challenges and successes they’ve encountered 
 when\nworking to improve EDIA. In a wide-ranging discussion\, they will 
 also consider why all RSEs\nshould be engaged with EDIA and how they can 
 offer support\, as well as broader philosophical\nissues around epistemic 
 justice. There will be time for questions and further discussion.
